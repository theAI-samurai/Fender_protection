# About the Project

  This project was completed on a freelance basis, and with the stipulated time frame of 3 months.
  We use RTSP camera to track incoming and outgoing ships, and raise an alarm at docks when an object/ship approaches too close to the Fenders.
  
## Implementation
1. We stated with yolov3 model, thought the accuracy was high, the Arcitecture failed while while deploying the model as multi-threading.
2. We then mmoved forwand with Yolov3-tiny.
3. The weight files for yolov3-tiny is included in the repository.
